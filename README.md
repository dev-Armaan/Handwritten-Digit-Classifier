# Handwritten-Number-Classifier
The Handwritten Number Classifier is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained to recognize handwritten numbers, using the MNIST dataset. The network is built using Keras, which is a high-level API incorporated in Tensorflow (Google's deep learning API). I have downloaded the entire MNIST dataset (on handwritten digits) as .jpg files, so that the network can be more "prepared" to analyze our hand-drawn digits, as opposed to just trianing it straight from the compressed MNSIT dataset.
